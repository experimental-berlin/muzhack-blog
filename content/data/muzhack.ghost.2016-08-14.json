The really cool thing about this module is the ability to manipulate its synthesis parameters (e.g. grain size/density/pitch) through control voltage sent by other modules, which really opens up for a lot of interesting possibilities in sound shaping.\n\n## Alternative Firmware\nNow, to the real topic of this post. Clouds, like Mutable's other offerings, is open, both when it comes to hardware and software. The community has taken advantage of this by producing alternative firmwares for it; I have installed the so-called [Parasite firmware](https://mqtthiqs.github.io/parasites/clouds.html) for it myself, and am very happy with the improvements it brings over the standard firmware!\n\nParasite offers the following modifications relative to the original firmware, according to its author Matthias Puech:\n\n* The Oliverb, a new, full-featured creative reverb mode based on the reverb of the original firmware (itself based on a description of the Lexicon 480L), and inspired in design by the Erbe Verb, with CV control over all parameters. It is largely modeless, probably unrealistic and goes far beyond your traditional reverb.\n* Resonestor, a polyphonic resonator processor with built-in support for your beloved Karplus-Strong synthesis. Plucked or fed with your favorite sound, it spits out strange guitar sounds, lush chords, evolving drones, and more.\n* More envelopes for your grains: the Texture knob allows to select ramp down or ramp up-shaped grains. Square-shaped grains have steeper edges for extra glitch.\n* Availability of much smaller grains compared to the official firmware.\n* Enhanced looping delay and time stretcher modes: tempo syncing with clock multiplier/divisor, support for stereo delay (ping-pong delay) and (crude) open feedback loop, much improved sound quality, faster delay time change.\n\n### Installing the Parasite Firmware\nThe Parasite firmware is installed [in the same way as the standard firmware](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/clouds/manual); by playing back a .wav file into the module's input. The author warns that there have been cases of the module getting bricked as a result of replacing the firmware, but apparently they have been few and far between (approximately 1%).

It was later revised in October of that year. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, this piece avoided the populist tendencies of fellow American composers at the time, while the piece's title is thought to be a call to collective unity.\n\nStyled as \"a dramatic playlet for Two Characters\", Cage described Credo in Us as \"a suite with a satirical character\". It was composed to accompany a piece of contemporary dance choreographed by his partner and collaborator Merce Cunningham and choreographer Jean Erdman, who performed the piece at its premiere in Bennington College, Vermont on August 1, 1942.\n\nThe instrumentation for the original performance included four performers: a pianist; two percussionists playing muted gongs, tin cans, electric buzzer and tom-toms; and a fourth performer operating a radio and a phonograph. For the phonograph, Cage suggests using something \"classic\" such as Dvořák, Beethoven, Sibelius or Shostakovich; and for the radio, to use any station but avoid news programs in the case of a \"national emergency\". Jean Erdman recalls that for the first performance a 'tack-piano' was used—one of Cage's prepared pianos, though the pianist is also called upon to play the soundbox of the instrument as a percussionist.\n\n### Karlheinz Stockhausen\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzwellen): In 1968, Karlheinz Stockhausen produced the composition Kurzwellen (Short Waves), for six players with shortwave receivers and live electronics. Each performer plays a series of events separated by pauses. An event may be played either with the radio or with an instrument, and it is also possible for a player to accompany an event on an instrument with the radio or vice versa, or to blend both together. Each event has a distinct duration defined by its subdivision into segments with a characteristic rhythm\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><a href=\"https://muzhack.com/u/aknudsen/musicthing-radiomusic\">Music Thing Radio Music</a> is a DIY <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doepfer_A-100\">Eurorack</a> module design by eminent instrument designer <a href=\"http://www.musicthing.co.uk/\">Tom Whitwell</a>.

This function too has a control voltage input to modulate its value automatically, which should have some fun potential.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/113050279\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>  \n\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/113050279\">Music Thing Modular Radio Music Prototype</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user215457\">Tom Whitwell</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"usersofradiomusic\">Users of Radio Music</h2>\n\n<p>Prominent users of Radio Music include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robinrimbaud/status/562663428830289921\">Robin Rimbaud (Scanner)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris_carter_/status/562889299621076993\">Chris Carter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/russellhaswell/status/552213743363690496\">Russell Haswell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/900BnMjQjw/\">Richard Devine</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"historicalbackground\">Historical Background</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"johncage\">John Cage</h3>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credo_in_Us\">Wikipedia</a>: In July 1942 American experimental music composer, writer and visual artist John Cage wrote the musical composition Credo in Us. It was later revised in October of that year. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, this piece avoided the populist tendencies of fellow American composers at the time, while the piece's title is thought to be a call to collective unity.</p>\n\n<p>Styled as \"a dramatic playlet for Two Characters\", Cage described Credo in Us as \"a suite with a satirical character\". It was composed to accompany a piece of contemporary dance choreographed by his partner and collaborator Merce Cunningham and choreographer Jean Erdman, who performed the piece at its premiere in Bennington College, Vermont on August 1, 1942.</p>\n\n<p>The instrumentation for the original performance included four performers: a pianist; two percussionists playing muted gongs, tin cans, electric buzzer and tom-toms; and a fourth performer operating a radio and a phonograph. For the phonograph, Cage suggests using something \"classic\" such as Dvořák, Beethoven, Sibelius or Shostakovich; and for the radio, to use any station but avoid news programs in the case of a \"national emergency\". Jean Erdman recalls that for the first performance a 'tack-piano' was used—one of Cage's prepared pianos, though the pianist is also called upon to play the soundbox of the instrument as a percussionist.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"karlheinzstockhausen\">Karlheinz Stockhausen</h3>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzwellen\">Wikipedia</a>: In 1968, Karlheinz Stockhausen produced the composition Kurzwellen (Short Waves), for six players with shortwave receivers and live electronics. Each performer plays a series of events separated by pauses. An event may be played either with the radio or with an instrument, and it is also possible for a player to accompany an event on an instrument with the radio or vice versa, or to blend both together. Each event has a distinct duration defined by its subdivision into segments with a characteristic rhythm</p>","image":"/content/images/2016/08/u-2Faknudsen-2Fmusicthing-radiomusic-2Fpictures-2F1_rmpic.jpg","featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1471207298305,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1471212042863,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1471212042865,"published_by":1}],"users":[{"id":1,"uuid":"28d7b5e4-a87d-4e4b-9b77-8a5098ef6847","name":"Arve
